operator explanetion:
+= : adds second graph to the first, if of the same size
-= : subtructs the second graph from the first, if of the same size
+ : adds two graphs
- : subtructs two graphs
++ : adds 1 to all edges, exept on main diagonal
-- : same as ++, but with -
= : truns the first graph to the second graph
!= : true if graphs are not of the same size or have at least 1 different edge
== : true if graphs are of the same size and contains the same edges
> : true if g1 has more edges or more vertices
>= true if > or ==
< : same as >
<= : true if < or ==
* : multipling 2 graphs, or miltiplying and int on graph
<< : prints the matrix that represents the graph
